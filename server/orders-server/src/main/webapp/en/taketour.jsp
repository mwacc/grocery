<div style="margin-right:12px;"> Go to <i>Grocery template</i> page, where ready-to-use forms are displayed. 
Imagine a grocery list printed on a sheet of paper, in which you only need to check out the right products - this is a template.
 Select the desired form from the list on the page and click <i>Create shopping list based on this template</i>. Now you're on the page with a 
 list of purchases, where categories are marked on the left side, while there are the goods that belong to this category on the right side. 
 Mark the items which you need, by clicking on them, if necessary, you can specify the number or add any other comment to the good. 
 No goods which you need? No problem! At the bottom of the column with the goods is the special field for missing items - use it! 
 Don't you think it is easy and useful? <b>Using ready-made template, you can create a shopping list of 30 goods in less than 30 seconds!</b> 
 When you finish creating the list, send it by e-mail or print

<div style="margin-left:12px;">Haven't you found suitable a shopping template for you? 
Create your own shopping template and use it in the future to create a shopping list many times! Go to <i>Grocery template</i> page and click <i>Create own</i>, 
thereby you find yourself on the page, where you can create a new template. 
 There are available products' categories on the left side, and the relevant goods on the right side. For example, you are sitting on 
a diet of fruit and nuts, so it makes sense to create a template containing the categories Fruits and Nuts. Then select the category of fruit and add 
a fruits, that you need. Then perform the same action with nuts. Saved template is now available in <i>Grocery list</i> page and
